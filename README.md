# The Snowman Tales

This is the first level of a 2D platformer game created using [Hexi](https://github.com/kittykatattack/hexi). 

## Plot
A snowman tries to obtain snowflakes to create snowballs that can be used to throw at penguins. When the snowman is successful, he gains points. The course ends when the snowman reaches a level with trees.
